# Core Java Fundamentals

## Class
Class is a template to create an object. It consists of attributes and behaviours of that object.

## Object
Is an instance of a class. It is created as defined by a template (class).

## Variables
Variables are containers which can store information.
Variables can be of different types based on what type of information is to be stored in it.

Types of variables:
1. Primitive
2. Non-Primitive

Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the Java language. These types serve as the building blocks of data manipulation in Java. Such types serve only one purpose â€” containing pure, simple values of a kind.
 - byte
 - short
 - int
 - long
 - float
 - double
 - char
 - boolean

Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String ).
 - String
 - Array
 - ..etc

Identifier -> name given to a variable.

## Constants
Constant is a container for value which cannot be changed once assigned.

## Methods
Methods are functions enclosed in a class. A function is a set of reusable code.
Lines of code inside a Methods are only executed when the method is invoked.


## Arrays
An Array is collection of multiple variables/constants/objects.


## Control Structures

Selection
- if-else statements
- switch case

Iteration / Looping
- while
- for
- -while
- for-each

Jump
- break
- continue
- return

---


## Inheritence
Copying attributes and behaviours of a class into another class

# Constructors
A special method which returns object of a class. It is the same name as of it's class.
 - Default Constructor
 - Parameterized Constructor

## Types of variables (based on scope)
 - instance 
 - static
 - local

## Access Modifiers
 - public
 - private
 - default
 - protected

## Interface 
A class-like body which specifies which methods that must be implemented by a class.

## Abstract class
A class whose object cannot be created.

## Overloading 
Method in a class with same name but different parameters

## Overriding
Modifiying a method which was inherited by a parent class
